<h1>About </h1>
<p>The Berea College Connect Autofill extension for Firefox and Chrome was created to improve various processes within Admissions and reduce data entry errors. Currently it is maintained by Jacob Patton in the Office of Admissions. For questions or comments, please email <a href="mailto:jacob_patton@berea.edu">jacob_patton@berea.edu</a><br />
</p>
<p>The functions below are based on the view in Connect and use watch for certain attributes to be available. Renaming a view or removing fields from the view may negatively impact the extension and cause parts of it not to work. This should show an error alert box. However, if a view is slow to load, this may also trigger the error alert box. </p>
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Below is a list of everything that the extension currently does.</p>
<dl>

<dd>- When the "Class Rank", "Class Size", or "Real Percentil Req?" is updated, the "Class Rank Percentile" is calculated and "Percentile Rec'd Date" is set for current date. (Note: If Percentile Required is flipped to "No", it removes the current percentile.)
<dd>- If "GED %" is entered and the "High School Transcript Name" is set to "GED", the "Class Rank", "Class Size", "Class Rank Percentile" are cleared, "Percentile Req?" is set to "No", and the date is set for the current day. 
<dt>Evaluations and Endorsements</dt>
